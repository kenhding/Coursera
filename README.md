## Reinforcement Learning Specialization


### Course 1 - Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning
#### Week 1 - An Introduction to Sequential Decision-Making [Quiz](https://github.com/kenzo0619/Coursera/blob/master/Reinforcement_Learning_Specialization/Course_1_Fundamentals_of_Reinforcement_Learning/Week1/RL_C1_week1_quiz_Sequential_Decision_Making.png)

*For the first week of this course, you will learn how to understand the exploration-exploitation trade-off in sequential decision-making, implement incremental algorithms for estimating action-values, and compare the strengths and weaknesses to different algorithms for exploration. For this week’s graded assessment, you will implement and test an epsilon-greedy agent.*

[Bandits and Exploration and Exploitation](https://github.com/kenzo0619/Coursera/blob/master/Reinforcement_Learning_Specialization/Course_1_Fundamentals_of_Reinforcement_Learning/Week1/RL_C1_week1_Bandits_and_Exploration_and_Exploitation.ipynb)

#### Week 2 - Markov Decision Processes [Quiz](https://github.com/kenzo0619/Coursera/blob/master/Reinforcement_Learning_Specialization/Course_1_Fundamentals_of_Reinforcement_Learning/Week2/RL_C1_week2_quiz_MDPs.png)

When you’re presented with a problem in industry, the first and most important step is to translate that problem into a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The quality of your solution depends heavily on how well you do this translation. This week, you will learn the definition of MDPs, you will understand goal-directed behavior and how this can be obtained from maximizing scalar rewards, and you will also understand the difference between episodic and continuing tasks. For this week’s graded assessment, you will create three example tasks of your own that fit into the MDP framework.

#### Week 3 - Value Functions & Bellman Equations [Quiz 1](https://github.com/kenzo0619/Coursera/blob/master/Reinforcement_Learning_Specialization/Course_1_Fundamentals_of_Reinforcement_Learning/Week3/RL_C1_week3_quiz_1_Value_Functions_and_Bellman_Equations.png) [Quiz 2](https://github.com/kenzo0619/Coursera/blob/master/Reinforcement_Learning_Specialization/Course_1_Fundamentals_of_Reinforcement_Learning/Week3/RL_C1_week3_quiz_2_Value_Functions_and_Bellman_Equations.png) 

Once the problem is formulated as an MDP, finding the optimal policy is more efficient when using value functions. This week, you will learn the definition of policies and value functions, as well as Bellman equations, which is the key technology that all of our algorithms will use.


#### Week 4 - Dynamic Programming [Quiz](https://github.com/kenzo0619/Coursera/blob/master/Reinforcement_Learning_Specialization/Course_1_Fundamentals_of_Reinforcement_Learning/Week4/RL_C1_week4_quiz_Dynamic_Programming.png)

This week, you will learn how to compute value functions and optimal policies, assuming you have the MDP model. You will implement dynamic programming to compute value functions and optimal policies and understand the utility of dynamic programming for industrial applications and problems. Further, you will learn about Generalized Policy Iteration as a common template for constructing algorithms that maximize reward. For this week’s graded assessment, you will implement an efficient dynamic programming agent in a simulated industrial control problem.

### Course 2 - Sample-based Learning Methods
#### Week 1 - Monte Carlo Methods for Prediction & Control [Quiz](https://github.com/kenzo0619/Coursera/blob/master/Reinforcement_Learning_Specialization/Course_2_Sample-based%20Learning%20Methods/Week1/RL_C2_week1_quiz_Monte_Carlo_Methods_for_Prediction_Control.png)

*This week you will learn how to estimate value functions and optimal policies, using only sampled experience from the environment. This module represents our first step toward incremental learning methods that learn from the agent’s own interaction with the world, rather than a model of the world. You will learn about on-policy and off-policy methods for prediction and control, using Monte Carlo methods---methods that use sampled returns. You will also be reintroduced to the exploration problem, but more generally in RL, beyond bandits.*

[Blackjack](https://github.com/kenzo0619/Coursera/blob/master/Reinforcement_Learning_Specialization/Course_2_Sample-based%20Learning%20Methods/Week1/RL_C2_week1_Blackjack.ipynb)

#### Week 2 - Introduction to Deep Learning [Quiz](https://github.com/kenzo0619/Coursera/blob/master/Reinforcement_Learning_Specialization/Course_2_Sample-based%20Learning%20Methods/Week2/RL_C2_week1_quiz_Temporal_Difference_Learning_Methods_for_Prediction.png)

*This week, you will learn about one of the most fundamental concepts in reinforcement learning: temporal difference (TD) learning. TD learning combines some of the features of both Monte Carlo and Dynamic Programming (DP) methods. TD methods are similar to Monte Carlo methods in that they can learn from the agent’s interaction with the world, and do not require knowledge of the model. TD methods are similar to DP methods in that they bootstrap, and thus can learn online---no waiting until the end of an episode. You will see how TD can learn more efficiently than Monte Carlo, due to bootstrapping. For this module, we first focus on TD for prediction, and discuss TD for control in the next module. This week, you will implement TD to estimate the value function for a fixed policy, in a simulated domain.*

#### Week 3 - Introduction to Deep Learning [Quiz](https://github.com/kenzo0619/Coursera/blob/master/Reinforcement_Learning_Specialization/Course_2_Sample-based%20Learning%20Methods/Week3/RL_C2_week3_quiz_Temporal_Difference_Learning_Methods_for_Control.png)

*This week, you will learn about using temporal difference learning for control, as a generalized policy iteration strategy. You will see three different algorithms based on bootstrapping and Bellman equations for control: Sarsa, Q-learning and Expected Sarsa. You will see some of the differences between the methods for on-policy and off-policy control, and that Expected Sarsa is a unified algorithm for both. You will implement Expected Sarsa and Q-learning, on Cliff World.*

#### Week 4 - Introduction to Deep Learning [Quiz](https://github.com/kenzo0619/Coursera/blob/master/Reinforcement_Learning_Specialization/Course_2_Sample-based%20Learning%20Methods/Week4/RL_C2_week4_quiz_Planning_Learning_Acting.png)

*Up until now, you might think that learning with and without a model are two distinct, and in some ways, competing strategies: planning with Dynamic Programming verses sample-based learning via TD methods. This week we unify these two strategies with the Dyna architecture. You will learn how to estimate the model from data and then use this model to generate hypothetical experience (a bit like dreaming) to dramatically improve sample efficiency compared to sample-based methods like Q-learning. In addition, you will learn how to design learning systems that are robust to inaccurate models.*
